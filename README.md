- **User Authentication**: Sign-up, login, and user profile management, with clear indicators for the current login status.
- **Booking Flow**: A simple and clear flow for users to book a property with minimal steps.

### Primary Pages Description

| **Page**                  | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Property Listing View** | This page displays a list of properties available for rent, along with key information such as location, price, and a brief description. Users can filter or search properties based on their preferences (e.g., location, price, type). This page should also provide a clean layout with large, clear images and essential details to attract users.                |
| **Listing Detailed View** | When a user clicks on a property from the listing page, they will be directed to the Listing Detailed View. This page will display more comprehensive information about the property, such as amenities, full description, reviews, and high-quality images. Users should have the option to contact the owner and start the booking process directly from this page. |
| **Simple Checkout View**  | The Simple Checkout page allows users to finalize their booking. It should show the booking summary, including the selected property, dates, total price, and payment options. Users should be able to easily confirm their booking with a clean call-to-action button and a simple form to enter payment details.                                                    |

### Importance of a User-Friendly Design in a Booking System

A user-friendly design is critical in a booking system because it directly impacts the user's ability to quickly find, view, and book a property. A seamless and intuitive experience increases conversion rates, as users are more likely to complete their bookings if they can easily navigate the system without frustration. Additionally, a well-designed interface builds trust and encourages users to return, as it reflects professionalism and attention to user needs. By reducing friction in the booking process and providing clear, concise information, the design ensures that users can complete their tasks efficiently and with confidence.

### Color Styles & Typography

In this project, the color palette and typography were designed in Figma. These design properties are essential in maintaining visual consistency and ensuring a cohesive user experience.


#### Color Styles
- **Primary Color**: #FF5A5F (A vibrant, energetic red used for call-to-action buttons and key highlights)
- **Secondary Color**: #00A699 (A soothing teal used for accents and secondary buttons)
- **Background Color**: #F7F7F7 (Light grey used as the background to ensure readability)
- **Text Color**: #333333 (Dark grey used for primary text, ensuring good contrast for legibility)
- **Button Hover Color**: #FF3B30 (A darker shade of red for interactive buttons when hovered)
- **Link Color**: #0077B6 (Blue used for clickable links to differentiate them from regular text)



#### Typography


- **Font Family**: "Roboto", sans-serif (A clean and modern font used for both headings and body text)
- **Heading Font Weight**: 700 (Bold weight for headings to make them stand out)
- **Body Font Weight**: 400 (Regular weight for easy-to-read body text)
- **Heading Font Size**:
  - H1: 36px
  - H2: 30px

  - Small text: 14px
  - Caption text: 12px
### Importance of Identifying Design Properties of a Mockup Design

Identifying and documenting the design properties of a mockup is essential for maintaining consistency throughout the development process. It ensures that the final product aligns with the original design vision. By specifying details like color styles, typography, and spacing, we can prevent discrepancies between the design and the implementation. This helps developers translate the design into a working product efficiently and accurately.

Additionally, understanding the design properties ensures a smooth handoff between designers and developers, promoting effective collaboration. It also contributes to the scalability of the project, as design decisions such as color choices and typography styles can be reused across different components of the application, resulting in a unified and polished user experience.
